This is my (admittedly feeble) attempt to modify the DictReader class implemented in the CSV module to replace empty values with a default value. This is born of a specific problem which I came across and thought it interesting to solve.

# To do

1. Edit the base signature to take a default value argument instead of using restval (already defined in the base class)
